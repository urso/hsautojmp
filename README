simple autojump clone in Haskell.

Unfortunatelly autojump became very instable lately for me + corrupting the database much too often 

- supports glob patterns
- case sensitive and insensitive pattern matching

(Testet with zsh only yet)

INSTALL
=======

- install hsautojmp via cabal: "cabal install"
  (on mac if you use macports on error type: "cabal install --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/lib")

- source "zsh/hsautojmp.zsh" to enable commands "j" and "jumpstat"

- copy "zsh/functions/_j" file to zsh's functions folder (e.g.
  "$HOME/.zsh/functions") for autocompletion for "j" command.
